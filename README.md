utfa
====

UTF-8 analysis for files and web pages
--------------------------------------

utfa.py is a Python script which analyses files or web pages into counts of all UTF-8 characters.  It can also (using -b byte mode) analyse the data into component bytes, e.g. where a file or web page is not encoded using UTF-8.

See the document ufta.pdf for background and usage examples using supplied test files 256 and u256 and various web pages.

utfa.py supports both Python 2.7 and later Python 3.x versions.

The name stands for UTF analysis (and also sounds a bit like UTF-8).
